### Changed

-   If you're using MkDocs>=1.5.0, the log messages produced by the plugin have the prefix `meta-descriptions:` instead of `[meta-descriptions]` since the plugin [now uses the built-in MkDocs logger](https://www.mkdocs.org/dev-guide/plugins/#logging-in-plugins) to help format log messages consistently across plugins.
